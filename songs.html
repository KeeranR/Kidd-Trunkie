    <h3>Preparing for Betrayal</h3>

    <h5>Verse 1</h5>
    <p>
        Last october i lost my homie that shnit hurt me hard <br />
        They wasnt playin got to spraying shot him in his yard <br />
        This march they locked up D-Bo screaming free my homie <br />
        Everybody say they real but i know they just a phony <br />
        Times got hard used to fall asleep crying into my hands <br />
        I said frack it almost dropped out i got a second chance <br />
        I used to cry and wonder why nobody understands <br />
        But I rolled the dice and I'ma play this *female dog* right where it lands <br />
        I lost somebody I held close like why'd you have to go <br />
        I fracked around and now my *donkey* is crying all alone <br />
        Before I die i gotta make sure that my name is known <br />
        I gotta get up before my name gets put in stone <br />
        I been betrayed ain't got no heart man that shiete fracking gone <br />
        I always thought that i was right but i was fracking wrong <br />
        I stayed loyal to this shiete thats why I write this song <br />
        i know i wont be here forever i know life ain't that long <br />
        the main reason im still alive is unknown to me <br />
        we broke up more than one i hope she'll still come home to me <br />
        I ain't ever really had shiete an armchair like a throne to me <br />
        <i>*now get up*</i> <br />
        Off my arse won't do what you do <br />
        If i say i love you don't ever tell me you too <br />
        You could tell me my feelings to be honest i thought that you knew <br />
        You lost me for good and i wont try to fix what you blew <br />
        My grandpas losing time <br />
        He a long way from his prime <br />
        I know one day he won't be here and I'll have lost that side of mine <br />
        Because i still remember the time when my grandma was dying <br />
        when she was gone i cried so hard on the ground was where im lying <br />
        my exes stopped caring after a while they just stopped trying <br />
        Cause i would never change and they got tired of crying <br />
        Tell me all the shiete you love about me bet you only got one thing on your list <br />
        How you get broken over someone you never even kissed <br />
        How you lose faith in somebody who you never even missed <br />
        They all know me as Kidd Trunkie not my name is fricking Chris <br />
        I wish my brother was alive i need someone to relate to <br />
        He ain't ever got to live always knew he would've been great too <br />
        I never held a grudge against nobody I'll never tell you that i hate you <br />
        I always meant to tell you sorry but i guess that its too late to <br />
        I had to go against the grain <br />
        I had to fight to keep my brain <br />
        Friendships i had to maintain <br />
        relationships left me with a stain <!--*or could say relationships left me in pain*--> <br />
        You can feel what im saying but you'll never experience my pain <br />
        They left me hanging out to dry so i just walked right through the rain <br />
        I walked out of the dorr and my heart wasnt intact <br />
        i knew that i had to leave before i got too attached <br />
        everybody like to judge me wy do i feel so attacked <br />
        i never accomplised shiete no trophies here not even a plaque <br />
        The game is getting heavy i got all of this shiete stacked <br />
        i always knew you were so heartless kindness was what you lacked <br />
        i should've left when i got hurt because u left my heart fricking black <br />

        <i>*chorus x2*</i> <br />

        I know every soldier gotta die one day    <br />
        i know i migh trip on that line one day  <br />
        so i put ur heart over my shoulders and i walk through the fire  <br />
        i got you as my desire  <br />
        two hearts connected by a wire <br />
        its me an you <br />
        i know you love me no you aint gotta say <br />
        i know if we together then i know you would stay <br />
        i never once accused you of ever being a fricking liar <br />
        i know you started to get tired <br />
        you applied for me and you got hired <br />
        i dream of you <br />

        <i>*verse 2*</i> <br />

        Hold on <br />

        shes petty when she mad but cute when she make that ass pop <br />
        if hes speaking on my brother i might make his fricking arse drop <br />
        I think i love her <br />
        when she mad i like to bug her <br />
        got her out the hole her last dude dug her <br />
        swear i aint ever cheated <br />
        all the girls that i deleted <br />
        cut em out of my life look at all the hearts i heated <br />
        I got that girl locked in my eyes <br />
        know she still love me im surprised <br />
        ill never tell her lies <br />
        cause i aint like these other guys <br />
        I say good morning everyday just to show her that i care <br />
        sometimes she takes my breath away i hope she gives me some more air <br />
        She send me pictures of her face sometimes i cant help but just stare <br />
        i know that other dudes like her sometimes i just get scared <br />
        cause i dont want her to leave me <br />
        im hoping that she see me <br />
        i hope that she dont deceive me <br />
        i promise you ll stay <br />
        wanna see you everyday <br />
        and if i cant then take my heart and make that shit berak <br />
        they turned into a snake <br />
        i know that they alll fake <br />
        im turning 18 put all that shit on top my cake *it today ;)* <br />
        The day i die i pray to allah my soul to take <br />
        i told callie i love her <br />
        ill hold all her pain above her <br />
        a good heart i know she would be a good mother <br />
        wish i had a fucking brother <br />
        i go visit his grave <br />
        all the flowers i gave <br />
        im hurt so bad that shit sent me right into a rage <br />
        i know i want her but i dont know if i can get engaged <br />
        cause i got trust issues what if the love i get is fucking staged <br />
        so i just turn the page <br />

        ill confess all of my sins and shoot the pastor <br /> <br />
